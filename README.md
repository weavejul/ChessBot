# ChessBot
A clunky chess-playing bot + GUI I threw together for a school project in freshman year of high school.

V1 and V2 were the two iterations I went through. VFINAL, the final version, works, while V1 and V2 do not, and are simply included to show the progression of the code. It requires pygame, and uses a GUI window and a terminal to play. 

Funnily enough, this was before I found it "necessary" to comment my code. Future me looks back in horror.
